Beige What
===

*Archived from old blog, dated 9 May 2014.*

> Beige is a very pale brown color, variously described as a pale sandy fawn color, a grayish tan, a light-grayish yellowish brown, or a pale to grayish yellow. It takes its name from the French word for the color of natural wool. It has come to be used for a range of light tints chosen for their neutral or pale warm appearance.

*Please note: What I am blaming here is the flawed, subjective system. At times, it may appear that I am criticizing certain people or parties. That was not my intention. Apologies if you are offended.*

And that's what Wikipedia has to say on what beige is<br>
Let's count the descriptions shall we?

1. very pale brown color
1. pale sandy fawn color
1. a grayish tan
1. a light-grayish yellowish brown
1. a pale to grayish yellow

Disregarding the fact that Wiki actually gave us the hex code<br>
(Which is, for your information, <span style="background:#F5F5DC">#F5F5DC</span>, thank you)<br>
(No, read it up close. I styled that damned box)<br>
So now the big question. What's beige?

Really, what is beige?
Ask any student in the largely Chinese community FPMU<br>
The answer you'd get would range from a shade of orange<br>
To the typical shrug of I-don't-know-let's-go-chiong-k<br>
Not say my England was powderful. It bad, no good<br>
But by the least, I know some complex words<br>
Like asphyxiation (from a certain metal band)<br>
Arrhythmia (a certain heart condition)<br>
Firaga, Thundaga and Blizzaga (FF15 HYPE)

If you ask me what is beige, I'd personally say<br>
A very light shade of orange. Very faint, but you'd know its orange<br>
You might have a different opinion of what makes beige, beige<br>
That's the whole point of this (rage) post

FPMU provided an image of what appears to be a beige cover<br>
In which I will not link here, in case I get shitted on<br>
But in my opinion... That's milky white, bro<br>
Like, bro, milky white, susu puteh god damn

My Friday began at 7 in the morning<br>
All my business is done with FPMU, except for this report<br>
Alright, I'll get it printed and pass it up<br>
At approximately 8.30, only one printing shop was open<br>
Hell, I have no time to wait for others to wake up from them slumber<br>
This, soft beige, perfect bind, kthxbai<br>
Along with my other mates, the order was the same

One of my friend had gotten his done earlier<br>
Well by god, the cover looks a wee different<br>
But aiya, it'll pass, it'll pass. Or so I'd like to think

When we submitted our copies, the lecturer was a bit skeptical<br>
The beige shade was a little darker than what she had thought it be<br>
But she accepted them anyways, for that short moment<br>
She called back later on, but out of four, two had gone<br>
The beige was not so beige after all

I tried to negotiate with the committee<br>
He was supposed to be there to collect these reports<br>
But he ain't, and I guess he's busy<br>
So the task was left to the lecturer mentioned earlier<br>
Where she asked the committee about this "darker shade o' beige"<br>
And he insisted, change them<br>
With all due respect, have you seen them?

> \- I ran out of money

With heavy hearts, me and my brother from same ancestor (same surname)<br>
We hunted for a shop, in which someone had printed from there earlier<br>
And had successfully submitted her report<br>
They are also somewhat a standard shop for people to print reports<br>
I mean, they had a whole template for FPMU<br>
Shit can't be wrong. It can't be. まさか！

(TL Note: まさか！ means BOOM! SFX)

By the time we were busted and all, it was close to 11 in the noon<br>
The azan had started berkumandang, and we grabbed lunch<br>
While the paper gets reprocessed, so to speak

By the time we hit back to the shop, our papers were done<br>
The beige was a much lighter beige now, admittedly<br>
Perhaps we did mess up earlier<br>
Perhaps this will be right<br>
Into the car, into the university<br>
Miss, this can't go wrong!

> "Cannot"

> \- what do you mean cannot

Nope. Not the right shade of beige<br>
Woah. Someone printed from that same damn shop, and it ain't right?<br>
Well, so I go out now and find another damn shop to reprocess?<br>
Until I get that beige beige?<br>
I's mad bro, **platinum** mad bro<br>
But most of all, I's broke<br>
If police catches me, I don't even have enough to bribe them!

The lecturer was understanding, and said<br>
While she can leave them on the table, she can't guarantee<br>
That it be the right beige that is beige<br>
I can't do no nothing, I am tired, I have to leave it be<br>
Else what, hit every damn shop that says<br>
"HEY WE PRINT BEIGE REPORT"<br>
I might as well Tour De Langkawi or something

> \- good question Mr. Holmes

If we take our copies to the shop, they'd straight claim<br>
That bloody cover you have right there is a god damn beige<br>
Hell I'd make that damn claim myself too for sooth<br>
But the lecturers in charge can only compared with the past reports<br>
If it ain't that beige, it ain't beige<br>
Hell if they didn't print it from one of the two shops<br>
I blamed the lecturers at first but then I realize<br>
They were only in charge to collect<br>
The beige they know is the beige they know<br>
What is beige then?<br>
What if beige was not beige?<br>
Then who was beige?

I came to realization then. The flaw itself<br>
Was the fact that they asked us to print a beige colored cover<br>
Everyone had a different idea of what beige is, its useless<br>
Hey if I said blue, one might say <span style="background:#06c;color:#fff">#06c</span><br>
While another might say <span style="background:#04c;color:#fff">#04c</span><br>
Subtle, but this is what killed me today

You want to propose a standard, then by god (all gods)<br>
You make that standard be, FPMU, not us<br>
You wanted that god damn beige cover for god knows what reason<br>
Probably for your OCD or autist needs, I do not know<br>
If you want a beige cover, give us the damn hex code<br>
Give us the name of the shop which prints your damn beige (YOU BEIGE)<br>
All damned shops there knows shit about what is your beige<br>
You gave that subjective beige color, you take that subjective beige<br>
What's wrong with this beige? It ain't beige? For sooth, it beige!

Shit's over for me. I got mad, I blamed people<br>
I corrected myself, I blamed the system<br>
That's what I can do. Get mad, get over it<br>
But for those who are still in FPMU<br>
Working on what is to be that final year report 2<br>
Take care
