Standalone
===

Was once a collection of standalone JavaScript projects.

- ### @attrib rash
	Some computers in the lab are infected with Win32/Conficker, as identified by [Microsoft Security Essentials](http://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/threat/encyclopedia/entry.aspx?name=Win32%2fConficker), which infects USB drives, and converts all folders and files into shortcuts. This application attempts to remove the malware. The malware has evolved over time, and this application is now not suitable to be used to remove the malware.

- ### @dns switch
	A DNS block was applied to the internet network in here. People decided to revert to other public DNS solutions, with Google DNS being the preferred one. Changing the DNS is simple, but the process is very much a hassle. The application provides a choice to either use [Google DNS](https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/) or the default DNS.

- ### mfacebook
	The mobile Facebook interface is not just messy, but rather lacking. This user script changes that by styling the mobile Facebook interface, and adding some trivial functions for non-Webkit browsers only. The project was discontinued as Facebook constantly changes its layout.

- ### @linux ping flood tool for win32
	There is no ping flood function in Windows. Several other applications were found, which claimed to be a flood, but are actually multiple instances of ping action. Linux has a powerful `ping.exe`, with the ability to perform ping flood in a single instance. The [Cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com/) release of the ping tool is called from a Windows batch script.

- ### Simple Java Compiler
	A small script that simplifies the process of Java compilation with console. The script runs `java.exe` and `javac.exe` from their respective locations, so there is no need to change environment variables. Besides that, the script also strips file types and replace them with suitable file types when you compile, run or edit the file. Low-level editor is available with [GNU nano text editor](http://www.nano-editor.org/), or the Windows built-in command line text editor, `edit.exe`.

- ### wifiscan.sh
	This small Bash script was made to make it easier to connect to access points. However, it is rather unorganized, and it only supports WEP encryption. This script was made as a proof of concept, and is not suitable for daily use.
