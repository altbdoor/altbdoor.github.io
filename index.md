Archive of almost everything I have done in my university years with some
educational resources.

Warning of what is to come:

- Most of the files are saved in [Google Drive](http://drive.google.com/)
  because it was more convenient for me to share the files then.
- I did not learn [Git](https://git-scm.com/) until the final stages of my
  studies. Most source codes are saved in text, if not lost completely.

Also, some of my experience which may or may not be relevant to you:

- [Untitled VN](http://altbdoor.github.io/untitled-vn/) - Have some fun with a visual novel
- [Beige What]({{ relative }}pages/beige-what/) - Beware of how your institution recognizes colors
