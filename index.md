Archive of almost everything I have done in my university years with some educational resources.

Also, some of my experience which may or may not be relevant to you:

- [Untitled VN](http://altbdoor.github.io/untitled-vn/) - Have some fun with a visual novel
- [Beige What]({{ relative }}pages/beige-what/) - Beware of how your institution recognizes colors
- [Python And Notepad Plus Plus]({{ relative }}pages/python-and-notepad-plus-plus/) - Python was a pretty snappy language
- Comic Fiesta 2012 [Day 1]({{ relative }}pages/cf-2012-1/) and [Day 2]({{ relative }}pages/cf-2012-2/)
